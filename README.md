# mapDemoEbitengineTiled

This was designed as a really naive demo showing the [go-tiled](github.com/lafriks/go-tiled) package being used with [ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/). 

I think https://github.com/shinjitsu/TiledWithEmbed is slightly better since it uses the go embedded file system stuff.

I couldn't find any existing demos putting the two libraries together so feel free to point me at one if someone knows of one.
